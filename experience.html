<h1>
EXPERIENCE
</h1>
<h2>November 2017 - June 2018</h2>
<p>
I was a student at the National Academy of Public Administration- (Major: Human resources). Start the first work at Joy Viet Global Co., Ltd a Korean Company in Vietnam at Real Estate field.( Main work: administration - interpreter)
</p>
<h2>June 2018</h2>
<p>Joy Viet Global went bankrupcy. The director introduced me to another Korean company (Plan ADD Viet Nam Co., Ltd) and worked as Real Estate assistant</p>
<h2>June 2018 - Now</h2>
<p>My journey with "Coding" started from this company ( of course until now).</p>
<P>The Plan ADD Co., Ltd is an architecture company. However, the Boss want to become a Real Estate Developer, he want to invest in the industrial zone.
He prepared himself a map ( Google My Map) of industrial zone all over Vietnam ( over 250 places). However, as we know a map with over 250 points look crazy
and messi. My Boss shared with me that he wanted a map that the small points can be grouped into a bigger marker at a particular zoom size. At that time
every staff thought it was imposible in my company because we did not have employee that know about computer science. However, in my mine always has
the idea that "all of the Boss order must be implemented". I stared research and after few days, I realized that I need to use the Google Map API.</p>
<p>- In December 2018: I finished the Cluster Map with Google Map API, with little knowledge about HTML. All of the code I just copied from many other 
source and customized to become my own desired map.</p>
<p>- In the first half of 2019, I worked as director assistant for Plan ADD Viet Nam Co., Ltd, took care for administration work, making contract,...</p>
<p>- In the end of 2019, after 1 year working I found that my work is boring and less creative and many repetitive works. ( our company uses Google suit
( Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Calendar,...). At the mean time, I applied to a 2-year MBA course at CFVG.</p>
<p>- January 2020, I found that Google Sheet with Scripts is totaly convinient and could help me to solve many problem, and help me to have an easier work.
I started learning Google Scripts and build up some small function for myself. However, I still wanted more, I decided to dig deeper, I tried to find a 
book to begin learning seriously about Google Sheet with Scripts, but I did not find any. I decided to folow VBA and hope that I could find out the pattern
to understand and apply to Google Sheet - I began with the book "EXCEL 2016 Power Programming with VBA" (Michael Alexander Dick Kusleika).</p>
<p>- February 2020, I finaly can code on Google App Script myself to build up several great functions, I still need support by researching Goolge. However, that 
time was different, I knew which question I need to search and slightly thought in the logic way.</p>
<p>- March 2020, I realized my passion with coding and decided to learn about computer science seriously.</p>
<p>- April 2020, I can basically manage HTML, CSS and a bit Javascript to make a little dynamic website.</p>
<p>- May 2020, I applied to CS50 online course provided by Mr. David Mallan (still on process).
<p>- June 2020, I started my small project to build a web-app - a site helps a coffee shop to make order and the history will be managed on Google Sheets. Actually
this is an order from my Boss, he opened a cafe where staff uses CukCuk App for placing orders, But the Boss want to control the data on Google Sheets. I made
a form from HTML, CSS and used Javascript to direct the data from the HTML site to Google Sheets.</p>
<p>- Until Now, I still on my way to learn about C programming, Algorithms, Python,...</p>
<p> I am happy to share my knowledge with all of you, if you need, do not hesitate to contact me. I also share my achievements in this site.</p>
<p> Thanks for visiting my Profile.</p>
